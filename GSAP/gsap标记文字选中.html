			<h1>THE CODE CREATIVE: Image Alt Text</h1>
			<p>
				Image Alt Text can often seem like an afterthought. What's the point of
				creating alt text once our images are already visibly working on our
				site? Alt text seems so simple at first glance that web developers can
				take it for granted without realizing how beneficial it can be for
				accessibility and SEO. By the end of this article, you'll have a better
				understanding of what image alt text is and why it's so vital. Writing
				SEO-friendly image alt text helps us get the most out of our images in
				Google Image Search, increases our rankings in Google Web Search, and
				allows our websites to be accessible to visually impaired users.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alt text, also known as alternative text, is used by screen readers and
				search engines to determine what an image is all about. It describes the
				content of an image and, hopefully, places it in a context, i.e., the
				context of the website or web page it's part of.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span
					>You might have also heard this described as being an “alt tag”.</span
				>
				However, this seems like a misnomer to me. I prefer to use the term “alt
				text” or “alt attribute”. Although we are “tagging” the image in a way,
				an HTML "tag" is technically an element enclosed in angle brackets such
				as an h1.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the world of SEO, one of the most important things we can do is
				create a page accessible to search engines and users. This means
				creating alt text for each image on our site, ideally including keywords
				related to our content.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of SEO, web crawlers (that index and rank sites) have to rely
				on image processing algorithms.
				<span
					>Search engine crawlers don't visually understand and interpret images
					in the same way a sighted user would.</span
				>
			</p>
			<p>
				As we can imagine, by omitting this information from our images, there's
				less of a chance that Google will index them. When we say "index", we
				mean that these images won't show up in the Google Image Search results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alt text is also an opportunity to use any keyword or keywords being
				targeted for SEO purposes.
				<span
					>While we don't want to overdo it and stuff our alt text with these
					keywords, it is a good idea to use them in at least an image or two on
					the page.</span
				>
